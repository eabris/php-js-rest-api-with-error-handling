# php-js-rest-api-with-error-handling

In this example, the PHP code checks for an invalid action parameter in the request, and returns an error message if it is not recognized. The JavaScript code uses the ok property of the response object to check for successful responses, and throws an error if it is not true. The catch method is used to handle any errors that occur during the request.
